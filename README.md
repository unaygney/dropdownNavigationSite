## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I had some difficulty, especially when creating the dropdowns during the project. However, it was an enjoyable and very instructive process while writing. I couldn't replicate the entire website exactly, but I still learned a lot. I set up the CSS grid and flex structure. Creating the header section using grid was quite easy and it turned out great.
